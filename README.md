# Javascript-Koans

This repo purpose is to understand testing and JavaScript. When KoansRunner is opened, runtime error and a stack trace indicating where the error occurred will be presented. The objective is to make the errors go away. As each error is fixed, a grain of JavaScript functional programming knowledge should be learned.
